                        <h2>About Me - Basem Mohamed</h2>
                        <p>I should start by saying I have a background in Mechanical Engineering. I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham in the UK and went into the Automotive
                            Engineering industry straight out of university. It was a priviledge to have had a hand in making some of the most exciting products one could hope to drive.
                            Having spent a decade in that industry and finding my curiosity in cars had peaked I became more interested in how software worked as it has gradually had a larger influence on our lives and our world,
                            not least the automotive industry.
                            At the time of writing I am 34 years old and feel as though my previous career experience has a lot of parallels with my future one in software development. I hope this site can help showcase some of what
                            I have learned and what I continue to develop.
